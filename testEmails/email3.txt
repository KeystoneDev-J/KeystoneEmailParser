Subject: Urgent Claim Update - Multiple Issues at 123 Elm St
Dear Claims Team,
I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to provide an update on the ongoing claim for our client, John Smith, who experienced significant damage to his property at 123 Elm Street, Anytown, USA 12345, during the recent storms. As the handling adjuster, Sarah Johnson (sarah.johnson@insurance.com), I've been working closely with our insured and his public adjuster, Mike Brown from Claimers Inc., to assess the situation.
The incident occurred on June 15, 2023, when a severe thunderstorm with hail and high winds caused extensive damage to the roof, siding, and landscaping. Mr. Smith, who's owned the property for 10 years, was home at the time and immediately noticed water intrusion in the living room and master bedroom. He promptly contacted our 24/7 claims hotline (800-555-1234) to report the loss.
Our initial inspection, conducted on June 18, revealed significant structural issues that may have been pre-existing but were exacerbated by the storm. The property, insured under policy #HO-987654321, appears to have foundation problems that complicate our assessment of the storm-related damages. We've scheduled a follow-up inspection with our structural engineer for next week.
In the meantime, Mr. Smith has engaged a local contractor, Bob's Restoration (555-987-6543), to perform emergency repairs and water mitigation. They've completed the initial dry-out and have tarped the damaged sections of the roof. However, there's a dispute regarding the scope of necessary repairs, particularly concerning the foundation issues.
I've attached photos from our initial inspection and the preliminary report from Bob's Restoration. Please note that Mr. Smith is quite distressed about the situation and has expressed concerns about potential mold growth due to the water intrusion. He's requested that we expedite the claim process and provide temporary housing if extensive repairs are needed.
Given the complexity of this claim, I recommend we consider bringing in additional specialists to assess the mold risk and separate the storm-related damages from any pre-existing issues. Our estimator, Jack Wilson (jack.wilson@insurance.com), will be preparing a detailed scope of repairs once we have all the necessary information.
Please update our system to reflect the following: Claim Number: INS-2023-789, Date of Loss: 6/15/2023, Peril: Wind/Hail/Water, Occupancy Status: Owner-Occupied. The insured can be reached at jsmith@email.com or 555-123-4567 for any further questions.
I'll keep you updated as we progress with this claim. If you need any additional information or have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
