Dear Reliable Insurance Claims Department,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing on behalf of our mutual client, Mr. Marcus Greene, regarding the grossly inadequate settlement offer for his recent property damage claim (Claim #: RI-2023-0501). As his appointed public adjuster, I must express our strong disagreement with your assessment and outline our demands for a fair resolution.

Claim Details:

Policyholder: Marcus Greene
Policy Number: HO-5678-9012
Property Address: 789 Oak Lane, Springville, TX 75001
Date of Loss: May 1, 2023
Peril: Severe thunderstorm (wind, hail, and consequential water damage)
Claim Number: RI-2023-0501
Mr. Greene, a devoted homeowner of 15 years, was present during the catastrophic event and can attest to the harrowing experience of watching his cherished home sustain significant damage. Your adjuster, Mr. James Thompson (james.thompson@reliableinsurance.com, Phone: 555-123-4567), conducted an inspection on May 5, 2023, at your office located at 456 Insurance Plaza, Springville, TX 75001. However, we find his evaluation to be woefully incomplete and biased towards minimizing the insurer's liability.

Our assessment, conducted on May 10, 2023, reveals the following damages that were either overlooked or severely undervalued in your initial offer:

Roof Damage: Complete replacement necessary due to hail impacts and wind uplift.
Water Intrusion: Extensive damage to ceilings, walls, and flooring on both floors.
Structural Concerns: Potential compromise to load-bearing walls requires further engineering assessment.
HVAC System: Lightning strike rendered the entire system inoperable.
Personal Property: Substantial losses, particularly in the home office and master bedroom.
We've engaged Precision Restoration (contact: Sarah Johnson, Phone: 555-987-6543, Email: sarah.johnson@precisionrestoration.com) for emergency mitigation to prevent further damage. They've installed temporary tarping and are monitoring for mold growth, given the extent of water intrusion. Mr. Greene has had to seek alternative accommodation (current expenses exceeding $3,000) due to the uninhabitable state of his residence.

Additionally, please note that Mr. Greene has been a tenant in a neighboring property managed by Reliable Insurance for the past 2 years, further demonstrating his commitment to maintaining his insurance policies and relationships with your company.

Please find attached our comprehensive 50-page itemized estimate totaling $328,745.23, which starkly contrasts with your proposed settlement of merely $62,500. This disparity is not only disappointing but potentially actionable under Texas Insurance Code Section 541.060, pertaining to unfair settlement practices.

We implore you to revisit this claim with the attention and fairness it deserves. Mr. Greene has been a loyal policyholder for over a decade, consistently paying premiums for comprehensive coverage that should protect him in precisely this type of situation.

Action Items:

Review our attached estimate in detail.
Schedule a joint re-inspection within the next 5 business days.
Provide a revised offer that accurately reflects the extent of covered damages.
Address the additional living expenses immediately to alleviate our client's financial strain.
Furthermore, we request that your handler, Ms. Laura Martin (Phone: 555-654-3210, Email: laura.martin@reliableinsurance.com), be directly involved in coordinating the re-inspection and subsequent negotiations to ensure clarity and accountability.
